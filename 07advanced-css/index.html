            <p>Vinyl records were created in <strong>1948</strong> as a way for people to listen to music in their homes. There are several different formats for vinyl, including LP, 45's and others. Vinyl records have recently had a resurgence in popular culture due to their vintage yet modern attributes.</p>
            
            <p><a href="favorites.html#sign">I personally have a couple of Vinyl Records myself.</a> It is very interesting to learn why these have regained their status in popular culture. <em>Paul Clements</em> wrote "It is fascinating, but perhaps unsurprising, to see vinyl officially overtake CD sales for the first time since the Eighties due to its appeal to new audiences, collectability and warmth of sound that all other formats, including digital, struggle to replicate." Vinyl definitely is back and bigger than any of the other formats. It is very interesting how it is recorded without digital equipment, yet sounds so good. </p>
           
            <h2>How Vinyl is recorded</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first step to manufacturing a Vinyl Record is to create the original Master Disc of an album out of an alluminum core.</li>
                    <li>After the Master has been created, it must be cut using a lathe. This is done using a sapphire tipped cutter and several microscopes. Once the master has been recorded successfully, it has a serial number placed on it.</li>
                    <li>After the master has been created, a stamper is made out of nickel using electric charges. This is used to press the new records.</li>
                    <li>Now it's finally time for the vinyl to be pressed! This is done by having a small puck shaped mass of polyvinyl be pressed into the correct shape.</li>
                    <li>Finally what is left is trimmed and then the vinyl record is good to go!</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Vinyl Sales Over Time</h2>
                <p>In 1993 only 300,000 vinyl records were sold. If we compare that to 2021 when there were 41.7 million vinyl records sold, it is easy to see how they have become much more popularized.</p>
